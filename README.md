# TryingOut-LLM-and-Langchain
Part of my course on edX(Databricks). I just checked out inference with LLM using HuggingFace works.

Didn't have enough compute resources to execute some instructions, I am aware there are way better ways to execute and do inference with LLMs, but this was just trying them out.
